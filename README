This is an open source android application. Please feel free to fork, bug fix 
and commit back. 

This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books. 
Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode. 

Features include;
* The obvious; you can add, edit, and display a list of books
* Books can be sorted by Author or Title. 
* Books can be automatically added by typing in the ISBN or scanning the 
  barcode. It will search Google Books for details (and download a thumbnail). 
  It will search more sites as I add them. 
* Multiple Books lists (or bookshelfs). For example I like to keep my Doctor Who
  books seperate from my normal fiction books. 
* You can search for a book by title, author or series.
* When adding or editing books author, series and publisher should display a 
  suggestion list
* When downloading book information, authors and titles are converted to proper
  case. e.g. "The murder on the links" becomes "The Murder on the Links"
* Using ISBN or Barcode scanning will also download a thumbnail (if available)

New in v2.2.
* There are two additional sort functions, by series and by loaned (Request from N4ppy)
* Your bookshelf and current location will be saved when you exit (Feedback from Martin)
* Minor interface improvements when sorting by title 

New in v2.1
* Your sort order will be automatically saved when to close the 
  application (Requested by Martin)
* There is a new "about this app" view available from the administration 
  tabs (Also from Martin)

New in v2.0
* There is a new tabbed "edit" interface to simplify editing books. 
* The new comments tab also includes a notes field where you can add personal 
  notes for any book (Requested by Luke).
* The new loaned books tab allows you to record books loaned to friends. This 
  will lookup your phone contacts to pre-populate the list (Requested by Luke)
* Scanned books that already exist in the database (based on ISBN) will no 
  longer be added (Identified by Colin)
* After adding a book, the main view will now scroll to a appropriate location. 
* Searching has been made significantly faster.

New in v1.10
* Fixed a crash on the phone (SQL Exception) 

New in v1.09
* Amazon unfortunately doesnâ€™t allow using their web services (search) on any 
  mobile devices, so this has been disabled until I can come up with a work-around.

New in v1.08

  The import function, expects a file in the same format, location and name
  as the export function created. 
* Improvements have been made to the search results screen to make it more 
  obvious
