This is an open source android application. Please feel free to fork, bug fix 
and commit back. 

This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books. 
Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode. 

Features include;
* The obvious; you can add, edit, and display a list of books
* Books can be sorted by Author or Title. 
* Books can be automatically added by typing in the ISBN or scanning the 
  barcode. It will search Google Books for details (and download a thumbnail). 
  It will search more sites as I add them. 
* Multiple Books lists (or bookshelfs). For example I like to keep my Doctor Who
  books seperate from my normal fiction books. 
* You can search for a book by title, author or series.
* When adding or editing books author, series and publisher should display a 
  suggestion list
* When downloading book information, authors and titles are converted to proper
  case. e.g. "The murder on the links" becomes "The Murder on the Links"
* Using ISBN or Barcode scanning will also download a thumbnail (if available)

New in v1.09
* Amazon unfortunately doesnâ€™t allow using their web services (search) on any 
  mobile devices, so this has been disabled until I can come up with a work-around.


New in v1.08
* Add by ISBN will now search Amazon as well as Google Books (thanks Sue)
* The series field will attempt to guess the value based on Amazon data 
* Fixed an issue for books where the date of publication is just a year

New in v1.07
* Fixes a crash if zxing (barcode scanner) if not installed (as found by Jesse)
* Adds a book count number to the main page (as requested by Keridel)
* The administration page now has a paypal donation link. Please use :-)

New in v1.06
* Import / Export and Manage Bookshelves have been moved to an admin page.
* Bug fixes in the Sort by Title view
* The options menu has been enhanced

New in v1.04
* There is now an option in the main menu to export all data to the SDCard. 
  This will be saved as a tab separated file in the bookCatalogue directory.
* There is now an option in the main menu to import data from the SDCard. 
  The import function, expects a file in the same format, location and name
  as the export function created. 
* Improvements have been made to the search results screen to make it more 
  obvious

New in v1.03
* Authors like "Marianne De Pierres" and "Ursula Le Guin" are now listed 
  correctly. They will list as;
	De Pierres, Marianne
	Le Guin, Ursula

New in v1.02
* The, An, and A should be listed after the title. e.g. "The Trigger" becomes
  "Trigger, The"
* Books lists should sort by Series, Series #, then Author (or Title)
