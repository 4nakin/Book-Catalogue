This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books. 
Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode. 

Features include;
* The obvious; you can add, edit, and display a list of books
* Books can be sorted by Author or Title. 
* Books can be automatically added by typing in the ISBN or scanning the 
barcode. It will search Google Books for details (and download a thumbnail). 
It will search more sites as I add them. 
* Multiple Books lists (or bookshelfs). For example I like to keep my Doctor Who
books seperate from my normal fiction books. 
* You can search for a book by title, author or series.
* When adding or editing books author, series and publisher should display a 
suggestion list
* When downloading book information, authors and titles are converted to proper
case. e.g. "The murder on the links" becomes "The Murder on the Links"
* Using ISBN or Barcode scanning will also download a thumbnail (if available)

Fixes in v0.2
* The, An, and A should be listed after the title. e.g. "The Trigger" becomes
"Trigger, The"
* Books lists should sort by Series, Series #, then Author (or Title)
* Aut
